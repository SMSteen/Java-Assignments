            <li>We may sit on the sidelines, but we are the <span>12th</span> man on the field! Our number was retired
                12/15/1984.
            </li>
            <li>Our <span>#12</span> flag, hoisted at every home game, flies right beside the American flag!</li>
            <li>The <span>#12</span> game ball was dedicated to us, 11/27/05, when our vocal support led the opposing
                team to 11 false starts and 3 missed field goals.</li>
            <li>We literally shook the ground on 1/8/11 during Beastmode's 67-yard touchdown run. The ensuing earthquake
                measured a magnitude between <span>1</span> and <span>2</span>.</li>
