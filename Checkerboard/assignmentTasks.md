Create a dynamic checkerboard. The checkerboard will allow users to pass their desired height and width and display a checkerboard to match those requirements.

For example, if user navigates to http://localhost:8080/Checkerboard/Draw.jsp?width=5&height=5, draw a 5 x 5 checkerboard.

● Allow the user to pass the height and width via query parameters and draw a checkerboard accordingly.

● Have your JSP handle the query parameters directly. You do not need to create a servlet.

● Use an external CSS file. Do not use inline or internal styling.

● Check the values of the query parameters inside of your JSP file.
